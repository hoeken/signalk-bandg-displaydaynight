Auto adjust the display mode (night/day/backlight) 

Currently uses ``environment.sun`` (derived-data) to set display mode and backlight on MFD.

Todo:
 - Add option to use lumen scale to set display mode and backlight level.
 - Figure out N2K packet to set mode and backlight level to allow plugin to work with Triton2 without needing MFD
